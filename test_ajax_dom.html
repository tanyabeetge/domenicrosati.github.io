         /*Api's are used in many ways by Javascript on the client-side - ie. code run by the browser 
         *There are lots of methods including some from libraries, such as Jquery, which make API communication really easy
         *regardless of how you do it - we usually call Javascript - API communication AJAX - Asynchronous Javascript and XML(or JSON) - this is because we do not require the browser to refresh each time we want new data
         *Here we are going to ask for JSON data from Yahoo's weather app for Halifax's current temperature and conditions
         */
  var callbackFunction = function(data) { //we are basically saying when the website loads, pass the JSON we have received from that script src below into a variable called data
    var condition = data.query.results.channel.item.condition; //JSON is literally a Javascript object, the syntax for which is just this.that.that.and.so.on, here I am just shortening it to conditions
    alert('The current temperature in halifax, in F, is:');//now I am going to alert you what the conditions are
    alert(condition.temp);//rember JSON is an object so condition is a short form of the above data.results... - within condition there is nested data I want - tempurature
    alert('The current conditions in halifax are:');
    alert(condition.text); //here is more nested data - conditions. text
